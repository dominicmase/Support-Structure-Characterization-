# Support-Structure-Characterization
Contains the python programs "flowfinder.py" and "planefinder.py" and the library "image_detection.py"

flowfinder.py is responsible for thermal characterization and will not work without "image_detection.py" as well as a folder containing thermal data in the same directory.

planefinder.py determines the realative "flatness" of the support structure using a minimization algorithm.
